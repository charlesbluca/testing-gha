# Testing GitHub Actions
This repository exists because sometimes I want to test trivial behaviors of GitHub Actions, but don't want these tests to clog up the commits of other repositories I contribute to. 

From now on, this will be the primary place I make random "testing" workflows, which more often than not will only be triggered through a `workflow_dispatch` and only serve one simple function each.
